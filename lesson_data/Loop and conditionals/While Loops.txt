While loops are used to perform an action until the condition is false.
The general syntax involves: 
While <condition>:
<Action>

EXAMPLE 1:

number = 0
While number < 100:
	number += 1
print(number)

Returns 100, as 1 is added to number until number =100, then the while loop is broken and the value is printed.
Note: number += 1 can be replaced with number = number + 1.
