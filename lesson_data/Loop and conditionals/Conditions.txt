The conditional statements in python include if, elif, and else keywords.
These are used to run code depending on the state of the program.

The general syntax for conditionals ae:
if <boolean expression>:
	<action>
elif <boolean expression 2>:
	<action>
else:
	<action>

Here, if the first boolean expression is true, the action is run.
‘elif’ is run if the first boolean expression was false and the second boolean expression is true.
Else is run if all previous conditions are false.

Note: elif can be used multiple times

EXAMPLE:
string = ‘python’
if ‘b’ in string:
	print(‘b present’)
elif ‘g’ in string:
	print(‘g present’)
elif ‘a’ or ‘e’ or ‘i’ or ‘o’ or ‘u’ in string:
	print(‘Vowel present’)
else:
	print(‘No tested letters present’)
Returns ‘Vowel present’ as the first 2 statements are false and the third statement is true. As one of the elif statements is true, the else statement does not run.
This is also a good example of using boolean logic, including the ‘in’ operator, to run code in python.

Note: nested conditionals can be created by using an if statement inside of an if statement.
