For loops are used to iterate through a sequence until each element in the specified range has been considered. This allows us to perform a task multiple times in one block of code.
The general syntax involves: 

for <variable name> in <sequence>:
     <Action>

EXAMPLE 1:

List = [‘This’, ‘is’, ‘a’, ‘list’]
For i in List:
    print(i)

It Returns,
    This
    is
    a
    list

As for each element in List, ‘i’ is being updated and printed.

We can use the range function and len to iterate through the length of a list.
This allows us to work with indexes, giving us more possibilities. 

EXAMPLE 2:
List = [‘This’, ‘is’, ‘a’, ‘list’]
For i in range(len(List)):
    print(List[i])
Returns the same result as Example 1.
