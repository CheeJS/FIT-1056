There are two boolean values: True and False.
These can be called in python for a range of uses.
We can use the equality operator, ==, to find the boolean value of an expression.

EXAMPLE:
sum = 1+2
print(sum == 4) 
Returns the boolean value ‘False’, as 3 is not equal to 4.

The three logical operators we will cover are: and, or, and not.
These can be used in boolean expressions and if statements to perform desired tasks.

If both x and y are true,’ x and y’ will be true. 
If either x or y are true, ‘x or y’ will be true.
If x is false, ‘not x’ will be true.

Boolean values and logical operators will become more useful once we introduce some of the following topics.
