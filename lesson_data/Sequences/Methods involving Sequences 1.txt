Methods are also built into python to act on sequences.
They are accessed by adding .method() after the sequence name, where ‘method’ is replaced with the actual name of the method.

Strings are immutable. You can only create a new string that is a variation to the original string, you can’t alter the existing string.
Lists are mutable. We can change an item in the list by accessing it directly as part of the assignment statement.
