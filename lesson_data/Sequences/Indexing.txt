Indexing is used to separate certain elements from a list or string
This is done by using a number inside square brackets, placed after a variable
The first index in a list is 0, then 1, 2..

EXAMPLE 1: 
University = “monash” 
University[1] returns ‘o’, as the index [1] extracts the second element in the string.

EXAMPLE 2:
List = [‘This’, ‘is’, ‘a’, ‘list’]
List[3] returns ‘list’, as the index [3] extracts the fourth element in the list.
