Python contains built-in functions which can be used to perform common operations.
We will be focusing on len() and print() in CodeVenture

print() simply prints a string or variable. Strings require to be surrounded by “ “.
There are many ways to print a string and variable in the same print statement, however we will be using the ‘f strings’ format.

Example:
Name = “John”
print(f”Hello, my name is {Name}!”)
Returns -> Hello, my name is John!

len() is used to find the length of a string or list in python.
Applied to a string, len() returns the number of characters in the string
Applied to a list, len() returns the number of elements in the list.

Example: 
List = [‘This’, ‘is’, ‘a’, ‘list’]
len(List) returns ‘4’ as List is 4 elements long
len(List[2]) returns ‘1’ as ‘a’ is 1 character long
