Data types define the type of a value.
There are many kinds of data types in Python…

EXAMPLES: 
Integer - ‘int’ (e.g. 3)
Float - ‘float’ (e.g. 8.51)
String - ‘str’ (e.g. “Hi”) 
Boolean - ‘bool’ (e.g. True) 

It is important to know what data type a value is for certain inputs and operations. (These will be covered in future modules)
