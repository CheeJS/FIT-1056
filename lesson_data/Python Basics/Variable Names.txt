It is important to choose variable names with proper programming practices and syntax
Variables must begin with a letter or underscore and cannot contain spaces

EXAMPLES: a, _b 

If this is not followed, you will receive an error

EXAMPLES: 2a, $b 

Additionally, if a protected ‘keyword’ is used, you will receive an error.

EXAMPLES: if, and, try, class, True, not…

It is good practice to not start a variable with a capital letter, but it is not required
